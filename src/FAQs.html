                    Why Penpot?
                </h2>

                <p class="text-2xl my-12">  
                    These are questions related to the fact that Penpot even exists or what is particularly different and new about it.
               </p>

               <h3 class="text-size-text1 font-bold">
                    Who created Penpot? Why?
               </h3>
               <p class=" text-size-text leading-6 my-7">
                    There is a company called
                    <a href="https://kaleidos.net" class=" text-primary hover:text-black">Kaleidos Open Source</a>
                    that has been long known for its commitment to free & open source software and a more diverse and inclusive workplace 
                    where cross-domain teams really enjoy working together. Kaleidos launched 
                    <a href="https://taiga.io" class=" text-primary hover:text-black">Taiga</a> 
                    a few years ago to deal with the absence of a truly agile open source project management tool.
                    The next major pain in our ranked list of outrageous open source absentees was a design & prototype 
                    tool like Figma, Sketch or Invision.
              </p>
              <p class=" text-size-text leading-6 mb-8">
                    At Kaleidos we believe that the tools that we use to build end products should be as accessible to everyone, regardless of their background, skills or purchasing power. Also, not having a free & open source UX/UI tool that would make devs participate in the design process and bridge the gap between UX/UI and code was a terrible itch for us.
              </p>
              <p class=" text-size-text leading-6 mb-8">
                    We created Penpot out of the need to enjoy design freedom for cross-domain teams.
              </p>


              <h3 class="text-size-text1 font-bold">
                    Why specifically Open Source?
              </h3>
              <p class=" text-size-text leading-6 my-7">
                    It's our very personal choice to make sure that we create tools that inject more freedom into the system. Open Source means pursuing a fairer society, where opportunities are more evenly distributed. Software Technology has the unique advantage, compared to other industries and intellectual property, of having almost 
                    zero cost to replicate itself, thus providing a wonderful chance to massively distribute the tools for a more digitally sovereign society.
              </p>
              <p class=" text-size-text leading-6 my-7">
                    Besides the pure license aspect of it and its legal framework, Open Source fosters more 
                    engaging communities where the lines between user and contributor are often blurred.
              </p>
              <p class=" text-size-text leading-6 mb-8">
                    In particular, we chose the very respected Mozilla Public License 2.0 because it made software 
                    delivered through the web or a service subject to the same rules as software that runs natively on your operating system.
              </p>


              <h3 class="text-size-text1 font-bold">
                    Why is SVG its native format?
              </h3>
              <p class=" text-size-text leading-6 my-7">
                    SVG (Scalar Vector Graphics) is a widely used Open Standard by the
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/"  class=" text-primary hover:text-black">W3C</a>.
                    It permeates the web, the mobile world and visualisation outputs across a myriad of platforms.
              </p>
              <p class=" text-size-text leading-6 my-7">
                    Embracing SVG was a technical challenge but it was a huge opportunity too. It makes 
                    a Penpot design itself valid code already. Moreover, the potential for integrations and interoperability are infinite.
              </p>
              <p class=" text-size-text leading-6 my-7">
                    When you are certain that a part of your design is SVG and you live-export that SVG as 
                    part of your code repository, you can have 
                    back and forth changes through the SVG files. Also, a “continuous design” process could be finally at hand.
              </p>
              <p class=" text-size-text leading-6 mb-8">
                    Using SVG means that there is no translation between a design and its “mathematical” representation.
                    The design is the SVG and the SVG is the design. This is a triumph for cross-domain collaboration.
              </p>


              <h3 class="text-size-text1 font-bold">
                    Why is Penpot different from [X proprietary product]?
              </h3>
              <p class=" text-size-text leading-6 my-7">
                    It would be tempting to go on a feature-comparison mode here. That's not going to happen. In terms of functionality Penpot is just fine already and with every new month, we will be 
                    bridging the gap between other well-known tools (founded between 2010 and 2012) and our hectic release cycle.
              </p>
              <p class=" text-size-text leading-6 my-7">
                    What is really different is the combination of four key elements:
              </p>

              <ul class="list-decimal text-lg pl-4">
                    <li class="mb-6">
                        <strong>Open Source</strong>.
                         This is a game-changer for the design and prototype world. It means
                          you can trust your designs are your own. You can adapt or improve the code or 
                          benefit from others doing so. You can host your own Penpot instance (also, native 
                          app in the works). You can integrate it the way you want. There's no limit with technology sovereignty.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mb-6">
                        <strong>SVG</strong>. 
                        The fact that we don't go for yet another proprietary format is a blow of fresh
                        air. SVG is what code needs and wants, making the cooperation between design and code suddenly much easier. 
                    </li>
                    <li class="mb-6">
                        <strong>Cross-domain team focus</strong>. 
                        Teams that are able to integrate many different skills and backgrounds and still enjoy a 
                        fruitful conversation (and project) are amazing to watch. Penpot aims to deliver the perfect
                         tool for visual designers that is wholeheartedly embraced by developers too.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mb-6">
                        <strong>No platform dependencies</strong>. 
                        Penpot requires a browser, that's it. If you want to host your own Penpot instance, that's 
                        fine too. We plan to release a native app bundle later this year.
                    </li>
              </ul>
              <p class=" text-size-text leading-6 mb-7">
                    There is a theme here. Universal access. That's why we love to call our product Penpot, theres
                    nothing more personal and yet more universal than a pot full of pens. It's all about choice.
              </p>

            
              <h3 class="text-size-text1 font-bold">
                    Why did you develop Penpot using Clojure and Clojurescript?
              </h3>
              <p class=" text-size-text leading-6 my-7">
                    Penpot is a very specific type of tool that demands high performance on the web. Penpot also has the
                    challenging task of seamlessly manipulating zillions of mathematical objects with no information loss. Functional programming languages like Clojure excel at this.
              </p>
              <p class=" text-size-text leading-6 my-7">
                    It is one of those instances where you absolutely need a specific technology to be able to achieve a robust 
                    tool like Penpot in a short period of time.
              </p>
              <p class=" text-size-text leading-6 mb-7">
                    Since Clojure is not (yet?) a mainstream programming language, we are making sure that 
                    there will be ways to extend Penpot using other more common languages such as Javascript. Also, at the backend 
                    level, appropriate APIs will be in place to easily connect Penpot with other platforms.
              </p>


              <h3 class="text-size-text1 font-bold">
                    Why did you release Penpot as an Alpha?
              </h3>
              <p class=" text-size-text leading-6 my-7">
                    We couldn't wait any longer. Back in February 2020 we promised that it would take as a year to develop 
                    a sort of 1.0. The “alpha” tag might be misleading, it's quite stable and feature-rich but in some ways it's 
                    still immature with regards to our vision.
              </p>

               
              <h3 class="text-size-text1 font-bold">
                    Why did Penpot move to Beta?
              </h3>
              <p class=" text-size-text leading-6 my-7">
                    Penpot is labeled as beta from the beginning of November 2021. Since its public launch in February 2021,
                    Penpot capabilities and benefits have grown at an astonishing fast rate.
                    Meanwhile, we constantly came back to one recurring question: Is Penpot really an alpha product anymore?
              </p>
              <p class=" text-size-text leading-6 my-7">
                    The combination of core features, maturity, stability and how comfortable teams seem to be while using it made the
                    trick. Also, we saw amazing validation from the community as a whole 
                    (take a look at our github). Learn more about the details behind the change

              </p>
              <p class=" text-size-text leading-6 mb-7">
                    Anyway, enjoy it for what it is, we will keep releasing iterations of our hopeful plans.

                    the company behind Penpot, has the resources
                    and the team needed to do that. If Penpot really succeeds and demands more and more resources, a bigger team and a
                    bigger infrastructure, we will need to find ways to monetize some aspects of Penpot. Many Open Source platforms have 
                    been very successful at that, without reverting to closing up the source code.

              <p class="text-size-text leading-6 my-7" >
                    SaaS subscriptions offer a quite valid and straightforward business model on top of Open Source. We are also considering
                    marketplace models à-la-Wordpress or big-enterprise-focused features for supported Penpot deployments à-la-Gitlab. No bullshit Open Core models based on some iteration of a “Tax the rich” sound reasonable but we’re still unsure about what would make sense. At the moment, though, this is something we don’t plan to address until 2023.

                    Source SL. It's the same bunch of people that 10 years ago created a company to build digital products 
                    for other startups. Many of us had been free & open source enthusiasts and hackers for over 10 years (mid 90's) 
                    already back then, so we wanted to make sure we stood behind our values around technology and society. Thanks to our

                    was born a few years ago. In recent times, we also needed something like Penpot, so we created an internal 
                    prototype, after which we asked ourselves whether it would be challenging but also cool to ditch all third-party 
                    consultancy contracts and just focus on OUR free & open source products. We said "Yes! Let's do this!". To name this

              <p class="text-size-text leading-6 my-7">
                    The easiest way to enjoy Penpot is quite simple. You simply go to
                    <a href="https://penpot.app" class=" text-primary hover:text-black">https://penpot.app</a>
                    and click on the Signup button. You will be asked to create an account. We only ask for an email. 
                    There are some authentication providers available, too.

              </h3>
              <p  class="text-size-text leading-6 my-7">
                    The easiest way to do that in Penpot is to create a team and add projects as you need them. All those projects and files will be available for your team 
                    and you will be able to work either asynchronously or simultaneously.
              </p>
              <p  class="text-size-text leading-6 my-7">
                    A Penpot user can be part of many different teams and have access to all their available projects.

              <p  class="text-size-text leading-6 my-7">

              <p class="text-size-text leading-6 my-7">
                    If you want to have a shareable URL to show your designs you can do it from the VIEW mode: launch it using the PLAY button at the top right of the file, and you'll find a 
                    SHARE URL button to create the link at the top right. Copy and send that link for other people to access the design.
              </p>
              <p class="text-size-text leading-6 my-7">
                    You can always invalidate a shared URL if you don't wish to continue to make it accessible through that link.

                    How can I use Penpot together with Inkscape?
              </h3>
              <p class="text-size-text leading-6 my-7">
                    Inkscape is a very powerful Open Source vector drawing tool. At Penpot we use it daily for our SVG creations. A very common use case we have is to use Inkscape to work with vector illustrations, icon sets and other graphic assets, before importing them into Penpot to create more complete and visually attractive interface designs. There are other tools that can complete your workflow, such as Quant-UX, which is very good for learning about your users’ interactions with your product.

                    Did the team find a pattern (design, interaction, tool) that could be improved but decided to keep it because the reference tools already made it familiar to the user?
                </h3>
                <p class="text-size-text leading-6 my-7">
                    Short answer would be no, we do not keep things from improving because of the potential loss of familiarity.
                </p>
                <p class="text-size-text leading-6 my-7">
                    It is true that we are using known patterns to ease the learning curve, this is part of Penpot’s strategy. Given that, we could say that “familiar” is included in our definition of success, but this might be for a different, also interesting, conversation. We do not hide that we have kept an eye not only on Figma but also on many other “usual suspects” (Sketch, Adobe XD, Inkscape, Webflow, Blender...) to study common patterns. However, our design decisions are based not only on previous research but also on testing solutions with users. Therefore, if we were to find that something works better for us in a different way, we’d go for it. Masks and toolbars are some examples of this approach.
