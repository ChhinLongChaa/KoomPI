## What is Penpot? ##

Penpot is the first **Open Source design** and prototyping platform meant for cross-domain teams. Non dependent on operating systems, Penpot is web based and works with open web standards (SVG). For all and empowered by the community.

## How to use ##

Login or Register on our Penpot cloud app. Create a team to work together on projects and share design assets or jump right away into Penpot and **start designing** by your own.

You can also install Penpot in a local environment. This section details everything you need to know to get Penpot up and running in production environments. Although it can be installed in many ways, the recommended approach is using **docker** and **docker-compose**.

<h2 align="center"> The Team </h2>

We have all the nice and queer hobbies you would expect from people that enjoy curiosity but, above all, we love free & open source software and pursue the right match between technology and its impact on society. We operate on trust and generosity and we make sure to listen to other people‚Äôs perspectives.

We are based in Europe with a truly global and inclusive aspiration, hence the name of Penpot, something so universal and accessible and yet so easily customizable and personal. An open tool that should appeal to everyone.

This team is a team within a team, [Kaleidos](href="http://kaleidos.net/"), which is the technology company we created in 2011 and that we decided to transform in 2021 to fully focus on our open source products. The other product is the award-winning and credited [Taiga](href="http://taiga.io"), an agile/lean project management tool. You should expect cross-pollination and interbreeding between both teams.
